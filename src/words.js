// I want to write a function that takes these words, and displays them all in a randomized
// generative way within a div.  The "Big Words" are in all caps and take up more space.
// The detailed words are in a smaller font and there are more in quantity.
// The words will be surrounding a div with an SVG in it.  
// The words will not be touching, but the space between them will not necessarily be even.
// The design of it is mobile first.  It works on smartphones, iPads, and desktop monitors.
// It is a full screen component.
